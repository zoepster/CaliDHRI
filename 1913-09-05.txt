Public Records in City Assessor Hallard’s 
Office Defaced in Violation of the Law 


Negroes and Italians Insulted— 
Grand Jury Investigation to 
Follow 


But a few weeks ago the voters 
arid taxpayers of this city were 
startled by the discovery that 
City Assessor Mallard's office had 
been used to discriminate against 
the poor and middle classes in favor 
of the rich by exempting property 
from taxation owned by the rich 
to the amount of several million 
dollars, while the property of the 
poor was assessed to the limit. 
This discovery alone was accepted 
by the voters as ample proof that 
the retirement of Assessor Mallard 
was absolutely necessary if justice 
was to be done alike to all tax 
payers. It will not be possible for 
Mr. Mallard by any process of 
reasoning to explain away the ex 
emption of three or four million 
dollars of property owned by the 
rich ,while the property of the poor 
is assessed to the limit. The 
trouble is, under Mr. Mallard's 
administration of the Assessor's 
office, the “lucky strikes” are all 
in favor of the rich. 

Records Defaced. 

Although the Negroes and Ital 
ians had borne their full share of 
the burden caused by Mr. Mallard's 
exemption from taxation of big 
slices of property owned by the 
rich, they did not expect the added 
insult to injury that the records of 
Mr. Mallard’s office held in store 
for them. This discovery was made 
a few days ago when Mr. Titus N. 
Alexander, a Negro real estate 
agent called to locate certain colored 
real estate owners. 

In field book 20, on page 320, he 


found to his surprise not the-names 
of the Negro owners and occupants 
of the property, but he found in 
every case where Negroes live the 
Assessor in describing the occupants 
of the property wrote: “occupied 
by niggers.” In disgust he went 
out and got Dr. Leggett and Mr. 
John Hall to go with bim and ex 
amine the records which they did, 
only to find them defaced as stated. 
The attention of one of the clerks 
was then called to the affair, who 
stated that the whole thing would 
be straightened out, and he hoped 
no publicity would be given it. In 
the meantime he invited the editor 
of this journal, Dr. and Mrs. 
Duvall to accompany him to the 
city hall and farther inspect the 
records. Field book 20 was delivered to the party, but the word 
“nigger” had been erased, the 
marks of the erasure being plainly 
visible. The gentleman delivering 
the book stated that the erasures 
had been purposely made, and that 
the defacements had been made by 
an extra, and that property owned 
by Italians had been written: “oc¬ 
cupied by Dagoes,” which he said 
had also been erased. However, 
he was unable to explain why 
these defacements of the public 
records had been allowed to remain 
undisturbed until discovered by a 
Negro. These defacements have 
undoubtedly been seen by scores 
and scores of people who search 
those records; and but for the 
discovery by Mr. Alexander those 
defacements insulting Negroes and 
Italians would have become per- 
menent parts of the records. When 
we called his attention to the fact 
that such defacements of. public 


records is a felony and the person 
guilty of such defacement was 
subject to an indictment by the 
grand jury he stated that the whole 
thing was the work of anjextra clerk. 
He seemed to have forgotten that 
Assessor Mallard was responsible 
for the care and keeping of the 
records of that office; and that it 
was his duty to see to it that the 
heads of the various departments 
see that the records are properly 
kept, reporting to him any irregu¬ 
larities that might occur from 
time to time. The defacements 
under consideration show that this 
is not the case. They show further 
that some of the departments seem 
to take care of themselves so far 
as Assessor Mallard is concerned. 
The making and preserving such 
defacements of the public records 
is absolutely without excuse. The 
whole thing was done to degrade 
Negro and Italian property owners. 

While this whole matter will be 
laid before the grand jury in the 
hope of punishing the person im¬ 
mediately responsible for it, As¬ 
sessor Mallard will find at the next 
city primary election out side of 
the West Lake district, he will 
have difficulty in getting votes 
enough to count. 

LITTLE STORIES OF SUCCESS 
(Number 5) 


The School That Edward Built 


In the Arabian Nights and in 
other stories we read of palaces and 
of cities being built by magic in a 
single night. The true stories of 
how many of the Negro schools 
have been built in the South are no 







































TWO 


THE LIBERATOR 


less wonderful than these fairy 
tales. Such a story is that of the 
school that Edwards built. 

In 1893 William J. Edwards 
graduated from Tuskegee Institute. 
The following year, with lots of 
faith, fifty cents and three students 
he established, in a log cabin, at his 
home in Wilcox County, Alabama, 
the Snow Hill Normal and Indus¬ 
trial Institute. There was no elab¬ 
orate prospectus showing what the 
school hoped to be, but down there 
in one of the most benighted of the 
black belt counties of Alabama, 
Edwards started in a crude way to 
minister to the needs of the people 
among whom he was reared. Here 
he has labored until the present 
time. Instead of the log cabin, 
there is now a school plant worth 
about $100,000. It consists of 1900 
acres of land and 21 buildings. 
Instead of three pupils there are 
now* some four hundred and the 
faculty has increased from one 
teacher to thirty-five. There are 
fifteen industries taught in the 
school. They are blacksmithing, 
wheelwrighting, carpentry, saw- 
milling, brickmaking, brick mason¬ 
ry, painting, printing, general farm¬ 
ing, truck gardening, dairying, 
cooking, sewing, laundering and 
basketry. 

The school is accomplishing the 
object for which it was started, that 
is, to help the people of the com¬ 
munity. When it was first estab¬ 
lished all the land owned by the 
colored people in the vicinity a- 
mounted to only about 20 acres. 
Now, within a radius of ten miles 
they own more than 10,000 acres 
In farms ranging from 20 to 500 
acres. The one room log cabins, 
in which the people lived when the 
school was first started, have been 
replaced by cottages with from two 
to five rooms, public school houses 
and church buildings, of which 
there were none, have been built. 
Through the Black Belt Improve¬ 
ment Company, the Farmer’s Con¬ 
ference, the Agricultural Demon¬ 
stration work and the rural school 
work, the influence of the school 
has been extended to every part of 
the country. 

Snow Hill has sent out something 


like 700 young men and women who 
are now' working in Wilcox and other 
counties as farmers, carpenters, 
blacksmiths, printers, seamstresses, 
teachers, etc. 

There are three off-shoots of the 
Snow Hill Institute. John Thomas, 
who graduated from there in 1901 
established in a section of Wilcox 
County, where education is badly 
needed the Hopewell Manual Train¬ 
ing School Another graduate, 
Emaneul M. Brown, has established 
at Richmond, in Dallas County, 
Alabama, the Streed Manual Train¬ 
ing School. The plant consists of 
4 buildings and 30 acres of land. 
There are about 250 students en¬ 
rolled. At Laurinburg, North Car¬ 
olina, Emanuel D. McDuffie, an¬ 
other graduate of Snow Hill, estab¬ 
lished in 1904, the Laurinburg 
Normal and Industrial Institute. 

Thus within twenty years after 
graduating from Tuskegee Institute, 
William J. Edwards has built up 
from a small beginning in a one- 
room log cabin, an institution that 
is a monument to himself and a 
potent force in the general uptift 
of the Negroes of the South. 


A GALLANT SOLDIER MUS¬

Obituary 


Capt. Edward Lee Baker 

(A Biographical Sketch from the 
History qt the War.) 


This distinguished young officer 
won bis medal of honor at Santiago, 
Cuba, July 1, 1898, and has a very 
remarkable and brilliant record in 
the army of the Union. He was 
born the 28th of December, 1865, 
on the Platte River, Laramie Coun¬ 
ty, Wyoming. He enlisted on the 
27th of July, 1882, in Troop “D,” 
9th United States Cavalry. Ap¬ 
pointed Trumpter the 2nd of July, 
1883, discharged July 26th, 1887, 
re-enlisted August 25th, 1887. Gen¬ 
eral Mounted Service assigned to 
Troop “B”, 10th Cavalry May 4, 
1888. Regimental clerk the same 
date. Appointed Chief Trumpeter 
of the Regiment February 9, 1890, 
promoted Regimental Quartermas¬ 
ter Sergeant January 28, 1981, and 


Regimental Sergeant Major April 
25, 1892, discharged August 24, 
1892, re-enlisted August 25, 1897. 
Appointed First Lieutenant 10th 
U. S. Cavalry, September 5, 1901. 
Appointed Second Lieutenant Phil¬ 
ippine Scouts, U. S. A., February 
17, 1902. While in the Philippines 
he served as Judge Advocate, Pro¬ 
vost Judge, Provost Marshall and 
also as Adjutant, Engineer, Intel¬ 
ligence Officer, Quartermaster and 
Commissary. He was wounded by 
shrapnell shell on the 1st of July, 
1898, at Santiago, Cuba, and won 
the Congress Medal of Honor on 
same date. As the 10th U. S. 
Cavalry approached the crossing of 
San Juan River it was subjected to 
a terrific converging artillery and 
musketry fire from the works in 
front. Still further to the left, and 
nearer the city, the fire was so 
severe that General Wheeler, com¬ 
manding Artillery Division 5th 
Army Corps, ordered the regiment 
placed behind an embankment for 
shelter. While there, and moving 
to that position, a comrad was 
wounded and fell into the stream in 
full view of the works. Where¬ 
upon, Captain Baker, then Ser¬ 
geant Major of the 10th U. S. 
Cavalry, voluntarily went to his 
assistance and carried him into a 
place of safety, after having been 
warned of the chances he was 
taking. His Congress Medal of 
Honor will be inherited by his el¬ 
dest son, Edward Lee Baker, Jr. 
Captain Baker’s long and active 
service in the army of twenty-five 
years and over, serving as private, 
officer, scout and Rough Rider, 
was disabled by a gun shot wound in 
the region of the stomach, which 
developed into stomach trouble. 
His family moved from Arizona to 
Los Angeles on July 4th, 1906. As 
the Captain suffered a great deal, 
he was advised by his physicians to 
go to the Presidea in San Francisco 
to undergo an operation from which 
he never recovered. He died 
August 26th, 1913. A beloved and 
faithful wife and five children sur¬ 
vive him. He was a kind husband, 
and an indulgent father. He has 
answered the last command.

BRILLIANT OPENING OF THE 
GOLDEN WEST CAFE 


In keeping with its name, “The 
Golden West Cafe” threw its doors 
open to a generous public on the 
first. The opening was greeted by 
a big crowd which continued to 
increase until evening, when the 
brilliantly lighted dining halls were 
packed. Under the glare of scores 
of electric chandeliers the night was 
changed to day and the gay corwds 
moving hither and thither amidst 
magnificent surroundings the whole 
took on the appearance of a fairy¬ 
land. 

The furnishings are all new and 
up to date, the tables being sup¬ 
plied with everything to be found 
in any first-class hostelry, and the 
services are second to none. The 
“Golden West Hotel and Cafe” 
supplies every public want and 
will, without doubt, command the 
patronage it deserves. The cafe 
alone furnishes employment for 
eighteen persons, all Negroes. Mr. 
George S. Brown, the proprietor, is 
receiving on every hand the con¬ 
gratulations he deserves. 


NEWS ITEM 


Rev. A. Hubbs, of New Orleans, 
will preach at Mt. Zion Baptist 
Church Sunday morning, Sept. 7th. 
Mr. Hubbs is a forceful speaker and 
will no doubt draw a large and 
appreciative audience. 


Right Rev. H. B. Parks delivered 
a short address at the Second M. E. 
Church, at the Furlong Home 
Tract, Sunday evening last. 


THE GROUND BREAKING 


The great ground-breaking exer¬ 
cises for the National Industrial 
Orphan School will take place at 
Watts, Sunday, Sept. 21st, at 3 p. 
m. An interesting program is be¬ 
ing prepared w lich will appear in 
all of the papers next week. The 
ministers and choirs of the several 
churches will take part. Every¬ 
body is cordially invited to attend 
these exercises and contribute some¬ 
thing for putting this worthy in¬ 
stitution on a permanent founda¬ 
tion. The trustees are anxious to 
raise $2,000 on that occasion. This 
can easily be done. 


A great lecture on Industrial 
Education by one of America’s 
greatest orators, Dr. W. T. Vernon, 
ex-U. S. Registrar of Treasury, at 
Y. M. C. A., Pasadena, September 
15, 1913. 

Dr. Vernon is one of the greatest 
colored orators of this couutry, and 
is president of Campbell College in 
Jackson, Miss., and is in constant 
demand, therefore the Citizens of 
Pasadena are fortunate indeed in 
securing his services at this time. 

Dr. Vernon is coming to Pasadena 
under the auspicies of the National 
Industrial and Orphans’ School, an 
institution that is filling a long felt 
want in this State, caring for in¬ 
fants and helpless children, giving 
them the right start in life, so 
every ticket you buy will be a help 
along that line. 

Admission 25 cents; reserved 
seats 35 cents. 


OFF FOR TUSKEGEE 


Chaperoned by Mrs. Katherine 
E. Barr, Masters Elmer E. Barr, 
Alva C. Garrott, Jr., Jas. M. Vena, 
Jr., Arthur Cole and Miss Marie 
Wrenn left for Tuskegee last Satur¬ 
day evening. Mrs. Barr, who is 
prominently known here for her 
worth and public spiritedness, has 
an engagement at Tuskegee for 
six months, after which time she 
will return to this city where her 
services are much needed and highly 
appreciated. 

The group of young people named 


above who will apend four years in 
Tuskegee to imbibe the “Tuskegee 
spirit” and receive the inspiration 
that our western young people can 
get nowhere else, is only the fore¬ 
runner of other groups which are 
to follow. Tuskegee is the greatest 
institution of the kind on the face 
of the earth, and young people 
entering there from sections where 
the Negroes are largely servants, 
and finding that that institution 
mighty as it is, is managed in its 
every department entirely by Ne¬ 
groes, receives nspiration and con¬ 
fidence in the Negro’s ability to be 
and do things, that is alone worth 
to each student so entering the 
entire cost of a four-years’ course 
in that institution. 

We especially urge our young 
men and women of this great State 
to take advantage of its splendid 
mixed schools and after graduating 
from its institutions of higher ed¬ 
ucation, which are free to all, take 
a post-graduate course at Tuskegee 
and get acquainted with the young 
men and women of our race that 
Tuskegee is annually sending out 
into the world to bring worth¬ 
while things to pass.

the business interest of the Negroes 
of this State to get together and 
pull off a State fair in a half a 
dozen weeks is simply preposterous. 
And yet this is what these two 
gentlemen are trying to pull off 
with the people denouncing them 
on every hand. Rev. E. T. Hub¬ 
bard is a preacher without a church, 
and Mr. Jas. M. Alexander, when 
not promoting such sencmes, is 
casniu in the Internal Revenue 
Office of tills city. 

All that has been accomplished 
thus far by t.iese gentlemen in the 
promotion ot this wild scheme is 
to secure $160 from the County 
Board of Supervisors and $50 from 
the City Council, ostensibly to pay 
the transportation of Ex-Register 
of the Treasury, W. T. Vernon, from 
Jackson, Mississippi, to this city 
and return—for what? Besides the 
$210 above mentioned, it is current¬ 
ly reported that quite a snug sum 
has been secured by private dona¬ 
tion. 


Rev. E. T. Hubbard is diligently 
calling upon the colored housewives 
for bits of home-made embroidery 
and fancy table doilies to put on 
exhibition at his fair next week as 
an evidence of the wonderful pro¬ 
gress made by the Negroes in 50 
years. Rev. Hubbard is acting in 
the name of the “California Negro 
Fair Association.” When and by 
whom was this association organ¬ 
ized? 


One box of Irish potatoes grown 
by a Negro on his ranch, or one 
box of oranges gathered from a 
Negro’s orange grove would show 
more real progress than a whole 
train load of fancy home-made 
doilies.
